# Feature Flags in Swift IOS Sample

[Read the blog post here](https://configcat.com/blog/)

Using this IOS app, Iâ€™ve demonstrated how to use feature flags with Swift. In the screenshot below, I have added an Upvote button as a new feature to be deployed. In the article, I examined how it can be linked to a feature. By doing so, I can toggle it on or off remotely without editing or redeploying the code.
