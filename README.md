# Feature Flags in Swift IOS Sample

[Read the blog post here](https://configcat.com/blog/)

This is a fictional IOS app created to demo how feature flags can we used with Swift. I've added an **Upvote** button as the new feature to be deployed as shown below. In the article I examined how we can link it to a feature. In this way, I can toggle it on or off remotely without editing or redeploying the code.
